  bio: "I'm a Founding AI Engineer at a stealth startup where I'm building the core AI platform from scratch — designing the architecture, and figuring out what production-grade AI actually looks like. Before this I spent years working on deep learning systems at scale. I think deeply about AI infrastructure, LLM applications, and the engineering craft behind reliable AI products.",
  shortBio: "I build AI platforms end-to-end — from LLM pipelines and multi-agent systems to computer vision at scale across hundreds of cameras in production.",
